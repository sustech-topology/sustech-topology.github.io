<h3><a id="24"></a>Talks in 2024</h3>

        <div id="24-1" class="toshow" style="display:none">
            Computational topology is an emerging discipline developed since around 2000.  It studies the determination and modeling of topological problems in computer 
            applications, as well as the design of algorithms for topological problems.  As a subject to apply computational topology to the field of data processing, 
            topological data analysis has been developed.  It has been widely used in biomedicine, drug design, financial analysis, machine learning, and other fields.  
            The main tools in computational topology and topological data analysis are persistent homology and Mapper.  Persistent homology constructs a sequence of 
            gradually "growing" simplicial complexes in a metric space, computes the persisting homological features (generators in the persistent homology groups), and 
            infers the importance of the features based on the life span of these homological features, thereby enabling the inference and extraction of global topological 
            features of the discrete data set.  On the other hand, Mapper extracts the main topological structure of the data set by defining a reference mapping on the 
            data set and using data segmentation and clustering.  Since almost 10 years ago, the CAGD research group of Zhejiang University has applied computational 
            topology methods to geometric design and geometric processing, and developed a series of computer-aided topological design methods.  This talk will introduce a 
            series of work in this area, including curve and surface reconstruction technology based on topological understanding, and topological control methods in 
            implicit curve and surface reconstruction.  Furthermore, persistent homology has been applied to the field of porous structure processing, and a variety of 
            topological descriptors have been designed for porous structure retrieval and classification; porous structure generation technology that ensures connectivity 
            has been developed; porous thickness computation technology that preserves topological structure and porous model slicing method have been proposed in 3D 
            printing of porous structures.

        <div id="24-2" class="toshow" style="display:none">
            Up to continuous deformations, all based continuous maps between two spheres form an abelian group, and is called a homotopy group of the target sphere.  It 
            turns out that determination of these groups is a very hard problem in topology.  The structures of the homotopy groups of spheres are closely related to many 
            topics in topology, such as the Hopf invariant problem, the Kervaire invariant problem, and the number of smooth structures on a given sphere.  
            <br />
            In this talk, I will review some classical methods of computing these groups, and discuss some recent progress.

            Lie algebroid and algebraic foliation are two natural algebraic analogues of foliation in differential geometry, which are nevertheless not equivalent without smooth condition.

        <div id="23-5" class="toshow" style="display:none">
            Modular forms are one of the most beautiful and fundamental notions in modern number theory and 
            play a role in almost every domain of pure mathematics and physics.  The famous specialist 
            Martin Eichler once said, "There are five fundamental operations of mathematics: 
            addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modular forms."  
            In the first talk I will explain this notion and present some highlights of the theory and its applications.  
            The last part, about the relatively new notion of "quantum modular forms" and its variants, is based on 
            joint work with Stavros Garoufalidis (SUSTech) during the last several years in which 
            many beautiful interconnections between number theory and 3-dimensional topology, and in particular the 
            so-called quantum invariants of 3-dimensional topology, were found.

        <div id="23-6" class="toshow" style="display:none">
            The study of congruences between modular forms is a classic and vital subject in number theory.  
            Hida was the first to establish the theory of $p$-adic modular forms with slope zero; Hida theory 
            is a core tool in Wiles' proof of the Iwasawa main conjecture, and also one of the main tools in 
            proving Fermat's Last Theorem.  Coleman extended Hida's theory to $p$-adic modular forms of 
            general finite slopes and, together with Mazur, constructed the eigencurve.  The geometry of the 
            eigencurve is essential for understanding the congruence properties of modular forms, yet our 
            knowledge about geometry of the eigencurve is very limited.  In a recent joint work with Nha Xuan 
            Truong, Xiao Liang and Zhao Bin, we prove the finiteness of irreducible components of the 
            eigencurve under a generic condition.

        <div id="23-7" class="toshow" style="display:none">
            In filtration 1 of the Adams spectral sequence, using secondary cohomology operations, Adams computed the differentials on the classes $h_j$, 
            resolving the Hopf invariant one problem.  In Adams filtration 2, using equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory, Hill–Hopkins–Ravenel 
            proved that the classes $h_j^2$ support non-trivial differentials for $j \geq 7$, resolving the celebrated Kervaire invariant one problem.  <br />
            
            I will talk about joint work with Robert Burklund: In Adams filtration 3, we prove an infinite family of non-trivial $d_4$-differentials on the 
            classes $h_j^3$ for $j \geq 6$, confirming a conjecture of Mahowald.  Our proof uses two different deformations of stable homotopy theory – 
            $\mathbb C$-motivic stable homotopy theory and $\mathbb F_2$-synthetic homotopy theory – both in an essential way.

        <div id="23-8" class="toshow" style="display:none">
            In this talk we will discuss two kinds of symmetric spaces. The first one is the moduli space of trees  which were introduced by Whitehouse for studying $\Gamma$-homology and $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-obstruction theory.  The second one is the complex of not $2$-connected graphs introduced by Vassiliev on studying  knot invariants.  Interestingly, their  homology as $\Sigma_n$-modules are isomorphic up to a sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$ and a degree shift.

            During this talk, I will show that this isomorphism can be lifted into topological level. Specifically, I will show that  these two spaces are in fact $\Sigma_n$-equivariant homotopy equivalent to each other.  This is  joint work with Greg Arone and Guchuan Li.

            In particular, in the summer of 2023 Burklund, Hahn, Levy and Schlank announced the negative resolution of Ravenel's Telescope Conjecture, which had been open since 1984.  
            That conjecture said that two categories are the same; now we know that they are different, and we expect to find a rich and intricate structure in the gap between them.  <br />

                    However, a key issue in all AI-based drug design models is efficient molecular representation and featurization. 
                    Recently,topological data analysis (TDA) has been used for molecular representations and its combination with machine learning models 
                    have achieved great success in drug design. 
                    In this talk, we will introduce our recently proposed persistent models for molecular representation and featurization. 
                    In our persistent models, molecular interactions and structures are characterized by various topological objects, 
                    including hypergraph, Dowker complex, Neighborhood complex, Hom-complex. 
                    Then mathematical invariants can be calculated to give quantitative featurization of the molecules. 
                    By considering a filtration process of the representations, various persistent functions can be constructed from the mathematical 
                    invariants of the representations through the filtration process, like the persistent homology and persistent spectral. 
                    These persistent functions are used as molecular descriptors for the machine learning models. 
                    The state-of-art results can be obtained by these persistent function based machine learning models.</li>

                        the classifying space of a Lie group in topology. The motivic cohomology (in particular, the Chow ring) of BG is

                    A closed simply-connected smooth manifold is projective plane like if its homology groups are the same as the homology groups of

                    The computation of stable homotopy groups of spheres is one of the most fundamental problems in topology.

                    a recent breakthrough on this computation, which depends on motivic homotopy theory in a critical way.  
                    This talk is based on several joint works with Bogdan Gheorghe, Dan Isaksen, and Guozhen Wang.

                    Number theory is the study of completely discrete things that can be 
                    counted or numbered, while topology is the study of continuous things
                    and of properties that are not changed by deformation.  So it is
                    perhaps surprising that questions of pure topology lead to surprisingly
                    subtle questions of number theory.   In this talk I will sketch several
                    instances of this phenomenon, starting with Euler's discovery that a
                    discrete invariant (now called the Euler characteristic) of a
                    topological space can be computed by triangulating it any way, and then
                    move on to more sophisticated examples: the "Betti numbers" of a
                    manifold (roughly speaking, the number of k-dimensional "holes"  for
                    each integer k up to the dimension of the manifold), the appearance of
                    Bernoulli numbers in connection with so-called exotic spheres in higher
                    dimensions, the appearance of Dedekind sums (another simple
                    number-theoretical object going back to the 19th century) in the study
                    of 4-dimensional manifolds, and most recently a whole series of
                    discoveries relating "quantum invariants" of knots to various deep
                    number-theoretical concepts (units, K-theory, Bloch groups, Habiro
                    ring,...). This last is ongoing research in collaboration with Stavros
                    Garoufalidis in SUSTech. The talk will be at a very general level and
                    will not require any prior knowledge.  In particular, rough
                    explanations of all of the various technical words occurring above will

                    tell more about one of the specific questions appearing above, namely,
                    the question of the possible Betti numbers that can occur for smooth
                    n-dimensional manifolds.  The answer here turns out to involve
                    elementary but quite hard number theory, and is quite amusing.  This
                    talk, too, is meant to be understandable by good undergraduates or by

                <div id="21-8" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    The theory of mock modular forms was created in the 2002 thesis of Sander Zwegers as a generalization of the 
                    famous "mock theta functions" of Ramanujan, of which Ramanujan had given many examples but no intrinsic 
                    characterization. One of the approaches given by Zwegers involves the Taylor expansion of meromorphic Jacobi 
                    forms, which have a "wall-crossing" property as some contour of integration crosses a pole of the function, and 
                    he noticed that the functions defined some years earlier in a paper by Lothar Göttsche and myself on Donaldson 
                    invariants of 4-manifolds, which were also based on a wall-crossing property, were in fact examples of mock 
                    modular forms before either the notion or the term existed. The same wall-crossing property occurred some years 
                    later in mathematical physics in the study of the string theory of black holes, the explanation there too being 
                    given by mock modular forms. In the lecture I will try to explain what mock modular forms are and how these 
                    various properties arise.
